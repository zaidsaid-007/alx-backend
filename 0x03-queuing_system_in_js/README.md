# 0x03. Queuing System in JS

## Description

This project focuses on building and understanding queuing systems using JavaScript, Redis, and Kue. The goal is to gain hands-on experience with Redis operations, asynchronous task handling, and creating a basic Express application that interacts with a Redis server and queueing systems.



## Learning Objectives

At the end of this project, you should be able to explain the following concepts:

- **Running a Redis Server on Your Machine**  
  Understand how to install and launch a Redis server on your local machine, configuring it to ensure smooth interaction with your applications.

- **Running Simple Operations with the Redis Client**  
  Learn how to use the Redis client for performing basic operations such as setting and retrieving key-value pairs, manipulating lists, and handling data structures like hashes.

- **Using Redis Client with Node.js for Basic Operations**  
  Learn how to integrate Redis with Node.js and perform basic operations such as storing and retrieving data from Redis.

- **Storing Hash Values in Redis**  
  Learn how to store and retrieve hash values in Redis, which allows you to store key-value pairs under one Redis key, useful for grouping related data.

- **Handling Asynchronous Operations with Redis**  
  Explore how to deal with asynchronous behavior in Redis when performing operations, ensuring that your application manages the flow of data without blocking processes.

- **Using Kue as a Queue System**  
  Learn to use **Kue**, a priority job queue backed by Redis, to manage background jobs, task prioritization, delayed execution, and job processing.

- **Building a Basic Express App Interacting with Redis**  
  Develop a basic web application using **Express.js** that interacts with a Redis server to store and retrieve data, demonstrating how a server-side application can use Redis for efficient data management.

- **Building a Basic Express App with Redis and Queues**  
  Expand the basic Express app to include job queuing with **Kue**, enabling the system to handle tasks asynchronously, process jobs in the background, and manage task queues efficiently.

## Installation and Setup

1. Install Redis on your local machine and start the Redis server.
2. Install Node.js and initialize a new Node.js project.
3. Install the required dependencies, including `redis`, `express`, and `kue`.
4. Run the application and experiment with Redis operations and job queues.

## Project Structure

- **Redis Server**: Stores data and handles operations.
- **Node.js Client**: Interacts with Redis to perform operations.
- **Kue**: Manages job queues for background processing.
- **Express.js**: A web framework for building server-side applications.
