# 0x00. Pagination

## Overview

This repository contains my work for the "0x00. Pagination" project, where I explored various pagination techniques in the context of REST APIs. The project covers key concepts such as basic pagination, hypermedia-driven pagination, and strategies for handling pagination in a deletion-resilient manner.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, I gained the ability to:

- **Paginate a Dataset with Simple Parameters**: Understand how to implement basic pagination using `page` and `page_size` parameters to efficiently retrieve subsets of data.
  
- **Paginate with Hypermedia Metadata**: Learn how to enhance pagination with hypermedia controls (HATEOAS) by including metadata like `next`, `previous`, and `total_pages` in API responses.

- **Handle Deletion-Resilient Pagination**: Explore strategies to maintain consistent pagination even when records are deleted from the dataset, ensuring a stable and predictable user experience.

## Resources

To successfully complete this project, I utilized the following resources:

1. **[REST API Design: Pagination](https://www.moesif.com/blog/technical/api-design/REST-API-Design-Filtering-Sorting-and-Pagination/#pagination)**: This resource provided a solid understanding of basic pagination concepts, including how to implement and optimize pagination in RESTful APIs.

2. **[HATEOAS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HATEOAS)**: This article introduced me to the concept of Hypermedia As The Engine Of Application State (HATEOAS), which is critical for designing hypermedia-driven pagination.

## Key Concepts

### 1. Simple Pagination

Simple pagination involves dividing a dataset into pages, where each page contains a subset of the total data. The user can navigate through these pages using parameters like `page` and `page_size`.

- **`page`**: The current page number.
- **`page_size`**: The number of items to display on each page.

### 2. Hypermedia-Driven Pagination

Hypermedia-driven pagination includes additional metadata in API responses to guide clients through the paginated data. This can include links to the `next` and `previous` pages, as well as information about the `total_pages` and `total_items`.

### 3. Deletion-Resilient Pagination

When records are deleted from a dataset, it can disrupt the pagination sequence. Deletion-resilient pagination techniques ensure that the remaining pages continue to function correctly and provide a consistent user experience. This can be achieved through strategies like cursor-based pagination or tracking the positions of remaining items.

## Project Structure

- **`pagination.py`**: Contains the implementation of different pagination methods, including simple pagination, hypermedia-driven pagination, and deletion-resilient pagination.
- **`test_pagination.py`**: Includes unit tests to verify the correctness and robustness of the pagination methods.


## Conclusion

This project provided hands-on experience with different pagination techniques, essential for building efficient and user-friendly APIs. Understanding and implementing these concepts is crucial for handling large datasets and providing a seamless experience for API consumers.
